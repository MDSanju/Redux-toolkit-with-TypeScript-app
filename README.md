There will be a login page where a user can login. Initially, there will be nothing in the home page. Once the user logs in, there will be a list of products the user created and a button where the user can create a product. 

## Product description:

There will be 3 fields: name, category, description. The category will be a checkbox with following options:
food
clothing
vehicle
Household accessory
